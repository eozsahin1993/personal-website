I am super excited to start sharing my learnings and experiences in my brand new website! This will be a space where I document my findings, tips and learnings-- mostly technical, but occasionally personal as well.

#### Tech articles
  
I plan to share a variety of tech articles including but not limited to mobile development, web development and cloud technologies. One of my personal goals is to have a set of articles called **'Today I Learned'** (TIL) where I will jot down my learnings for the day. My aim is to keep myself accountable and try to learn as much as I can. After all, consistent improvements add up over time, thanks to the power of compounding.

#### Announcements

Beyond tech articles, I'll also be posting personal or tech related announcements as well. After all, I don't use twitter (or X) and donâ€™t have much of a desire to :)

To keep articles relatively organized, I will be heavily using tags. Stay tuned!
