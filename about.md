### Hey I'm Emre 👋

I’m a software engineer with a **decade of experience** who loves building things—whether it’s a slick mobile app, a scalable backend, or a smooth web experience. I currently live in **Atlanta, GA** and work as a **full-stack engineer at Kustomer**. 

I graduated with a **bachelor's degree in computer engineering** from **Purdue University** and started my career as an **Android engineer**, crafting apps that people actually enjoy using. These days, I’m diving deeper into **full-stack development and cloud technologies**. 

I’ve had the privilege of working at companies of different scales and industries, including **VMware**, **SeedFi**, and **Credit Karma**.

When I’m not coding, you’ll probably find me playing soccer ⚽, recording a DJ set 🎵, or playing board games with family and friends ♟️.

Let's connect! I am available via [linkedin](https://www.linkedin.com/in/eozsahin1993/) or [email](mailto:eozsahin1993@gmail.com).
